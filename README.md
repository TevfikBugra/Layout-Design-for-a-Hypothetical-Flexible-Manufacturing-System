# Layout-Design-for-a-Hypothetical-Flexible-Manufacturing-System
This repository includes the resarch and analysis of a layout design for a hypothetical flexible manufacturing system.

## Abstract
 The objective of this research is to create the design of a hypothetical flexible
 manufacturing system (FMS) using the problem description and production data. Heuristic
 algorithms and improvement methods are used to reach the local optimal solution.
